# Twitter ETL Pipeline Python
This pipeline was created using python

This project was develop to familiarise myself with building a data infrastructure that would extract data from a single or multiple source, transform the data based on my likings and load the data into the cloud (ETL). The PDF file would hopefully allow the reader to understand the process and also take notes on what could be further improved.

The tweets were stream for 48 hours and only load the tweets that contains covid related tweets. 

# Additional analysis
The loaded data were then also undergoes EMR cluster management / analysis to simulate a big data management process using AWS.

# Technologies
Python (Jupyter Notebook)
AWS (Lambda,S3,DynamoDB, Apache Hadoop, HiveQL)
