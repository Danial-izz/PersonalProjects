# NBA and EuroLeague Playstyle Comparison using PCA and Clustering
This analysis would be analyzed using SAS OnDemand Statistical Software.

The datasets for this analysis would be web scraped from Basketball-references.com and NBA.com using Beautiful Soup.

Hierchical cluster analysis and Principal Component Analysis were done on the datasets to produce a pattern on the different playstyle in the NBA and  the EuroLeague.
Additional Linear Regression was done on the NBA player salary datasets to establish the important stats that would increase/decrease the player's salary. 

## Results
The findings from the Linear Regression stated the player that can contribute both on defense and offense would obtained a higher salary on the following year.
However, later research should include the celebrity status ie: Instagram/Twitter followers to further increase the model accuracy

The findings from Both Cluster and PCA analysis shows that the EuroLeague has more team-oriented players while the NBA has higher high usage players.
