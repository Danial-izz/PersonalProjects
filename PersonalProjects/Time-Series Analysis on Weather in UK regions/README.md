# Time-Series Analysis on Weather in UK Regions

The time-series would be analyzed using R programming language. 

The datasets for this analysis was obtained by downloading the datasets using R from the link below:
https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/climate/maps-and-data/uk-and-regional-series

There are 3 type of parameters chosen for the time-series and there are 10 region for each type of parameters. This resulted in a total of 30 Time-series Analysis.

Each Time series would undergo trend and seasonality removal to fit all datasets into an ARMA model. The prediction result would then be analyzed.
Prior to the ARMA model, the prediction using trend and seasonality would also be analyzed.
