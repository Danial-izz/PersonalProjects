 ## Background 

 Hello World!
 
My name is Danial izz and i am currently a Masters student in Data Science at University of South Wales. Prior to taking my Masters Degree, I received my degree in Mechanical Engineering at University of South Wales. I became intrigue with analyzing data as i was doing my dissertation/thesis on **Simulating a Stand-Alone Renewable-Energy Powered Community with Hydrogen as its Energy Storage**. Collecting montly energy demand data using a simulation software and using the data to further on simulate a renewable-energy powered community lead me to fall in love with programming and data science.

Now i focus on being a critical analyzer and programmer to either tackle my existing school assesment or personal projects that raise my interest!
